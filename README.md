# T2D-Drug-Repurposing-
Research Project with Broad Institute of MIT &amp; Harvard (2018-2019)

Note: This is only publically available code and results. All other code for the project was maintained by Adit and the Broad Insitute (including all private data collected and used for the project). Drug screening was completed using DrugBank database

- Glyc_NO_Freq_Final.ipynb: Screen with Glyc but without frequencies
- Glyc_tension+Freq_Final_drugs.ipynb: Final Drug screening for glyc and frequency analysis
- NoFreq_Final_drugs_with_side_effects_and_targets-.ipynb: Account for side effects, but no frequency analysis
- drugs_primary_effect_blood_glucose.ipynb: Look at drugs with primary effect of blood glucose

The above are all drug screenings based on publically-available information. These were further refined to identify three repurposing targets for T2D using privately-collected exome sequence data collected by the Broad Instiute.
